## Overview

A tracking library that raises DOM events / Netwrok calls when suspicious activity are made on web apps with the intent of detecting in-progress/attempted XSS exploits & http requests to blackisted URI(s).

## Motivation

**Content Security Policy** (CSP) is already very mature and here to stay and a lot of product and development teams are using it to mitigate XSS attacks an alien HTTP requests from the front-end. However, attckers have figured out very nice ways of circumventing CSP level-2 and level-3. Also there are claims that CSP directives interfere with the workings of bookmarklets/browser extensions.

For instance, a simple &lt;meta&gt; tag can be used to override policy directives from a CSP HTTP Header sent from the server. 

Also, **browser extension** can start causing all manner of [policy violation errors to be reported](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32336860/why-would-i-get-a-csp-violation-for-the-blocked-uri-about) to be repoted albiet unexpectedly. The side-effect can pile up pretty fast and begin to inflict pain in the development process.

So, having worked with CSP directives (in sizeable manner of mixes) myself, i began to try to figure out a way to do more things in a way that side-steps all the unintended side effects. So i came around coding up a "polyfill" for CSP

### More Motivation (CSP Support Issues / Bugs)

A [bug in Chrome](https://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com.au/2016/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) was fixed in v55 that allowed a would-be blocked URI from being allowed for for the "form-action" directive
A bug also exists for CSP in Edge v17 as well that 

The CSP directives below have very poor cross-browser support

- `require-sri-for`
- `worker-src`

`X-XSS-Protection` header is not supported in Firefox and has cross-browser issues too with Chrome/Safari/Edge/Internet Explorer
older versions of Firefox do support the `reflected-xss` but it was deprected when CSP level-3 was released.

The `Trusted Types` [draft specification](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/blob/master/README.md) made popular by Googles' ideas on **Trusted HTML** and **Trusted URLs** and **Trusted Scripts** (experimental APIs) to help protect security chokepoints (injection sinks) in the DOM (or other DOM related APIs) from being easily explioted using XSS techniques using these _value objects_. This project draws inspiration from this spec document to provide protection polyfills to all major DOM APIs. We hope to provide several complimentary code interface contexts fot `Trusted Types` in the codebase for CodeSplinta.

## Perks

- Consistently report **Content Security Policy** (CSP) violations
- Make it easier to implement CSP without getting bruised by the side-effects
- Polyfill "most" **Content Security Policy** (CSP) directives (especially `connect-src`, `require-sri-for`, `worker-src`)
- JavaScript errors reported
- Intercept DOM manipulation activities - `appendChild()` , `removeChild()`, `replaceChild()`, `innerHTML`, `innerText`, `value`
- Detect DevTools tampering
- Provide fallback for `X-XSS-Protection` header by cleaning/sanitizing `innerText`, `innerHTML`, `value` textual entries

This library makes use of [DOMPurify](https://www.github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/) internally to clean out calls to `innerHTML`, `innerText`, `appendChild()`, `replaceChild()`, `removeChild()`, `insertBefore()`, `value`

## Caveats

- `base-uri` and `plugin-types` CSP directives are not considered by this library as they're hardly used out there in the wild

## Getting Started

```js

const includesDomain(refDomain, whiteList){
	if(whiteList.indexOf(refDomain) + 1){
		return true;
	}
	
	return false;
}

document.addEventListener('beforerequest', (e) => {
    let white_list = ['https://reporting.codesplinta.co', 'https://platform.twitter.com', 'https://fonts.googleapis.com', 'https://www.youtube.com'];
    
    if(! includesDomain(e.detail.endpoint, white_list)){ 
        e.preventDefault(); // causes an error to be thrown
    };
});

document.addEventListener('devtoolschange', (e) => {
	console.log('is DevTools open ?', e.detail.open);
	console.log('DevTools orientation: ', e.detail.orientation);
});

document.addEventListener('MutatedDOM', function(e){
	var targetingNode = e.detail.node;
	var targetNode = e.detail.target;
 
      	switch(e.detail.action){
		case "removed":
			alert(targetNode.nodeName + " is being removed")
		break;
      	}

}, false)
```

## Browser Support

This library ustilizes 2 vital ES6 entities - `Proxy` and `Symbol`

- Internet Explorer 9+
- Edge 16+
- Firefox 14+
- Chrome 12+
- Safari 7+
- Opera 15+

> TLDR; For older Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE browsers that don't support the [Proxy Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/), you can polyfill/shim using [Chrome's Proxy polyfill library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/proxy-polyfill/) for `new Proxy({}, {});` and [Lebedev Konstantin's Performace API polyfill script](https://gist.github.com/RubaXa/8662836) as well as [Rousan Ali's Symbol polyfill library](https://github.com/rousan/symbol-es6/) if you ever need it.
